USAGE:

$ sudo install.sh [ bg | gtk | gnome* | conky ]

  *gnomish theme installer needs work


DEPENDS ON:

[LMDE, conky, qiv]


NOTES:

* Conky installer installs configs only. You need to apt-get conky and, possibly, qiv if you have transparency problems with the desktop and conky. Here's what the conky_delay_start script does (ver. 0.03x, before starting conky:

qiv --root /usr/share/lcars_gx/default_lcars_gx.jpg
